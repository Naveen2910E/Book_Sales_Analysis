# 📘 Book Sales Analysis Using Python | Data Cleaning, EDA & Insights

# I recently completed a comprehensive Book Sales Analysis project where I explored a dataset containing 1,000+ books, including their publishing information, ratings, genres, sales numbers,  revenue, authors, and languages.
# This project helped me practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and extracting actionable business insights.

# 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

# Python
# Pandas, NumPy
# Matplotlib & Seaborn
# Jupyter Notebook

# 🔍 Key Steps I Performed
# 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Pre-processing

Removed invalid publishing years (negative years) as seen in the dataset (Page 2–3) 

Book_sales_Analysis

Handled missing values in Book Name and language_code (Page 3–4)

Ensured there were no duplicate entries (0 duplicates).

Checked unique values for each column (Page 4).

# 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I analyzed the dataset from multiple angles:

# 📊 Publishing Year Distribution

A histogram (Page 4) shows most books were published between 1985–2015, indicating modern content dominates the dataset.

# 📚 Genre Analysis

Based on the bar chart (Page 6) 

Book_sales_Analysis

:

Genre fiction dominates with ~750 books.

Nonfiction, children, and fiction follow.

# ⭐ Book Ratings Analysis

The boxplot (Page 7) reveals:

Most genres have consistent ratings between 3.8 and 4.2.

Some outliers in genre fiction show very high or very low ratings.

# 💸 Sale Price vs. Units Sold

Scatter plot (Page 7) shows no strong negative relationship, meaning:

Higher price does not always reduce sales drastically.

Units sold depend more on popularity than price.

# 🌍 Language Distribution of Books

Language distribution (Page 8) indicates:

“eng” (English) dominates with 670 books.

Followed by “en-US” (226) and “en-GB”.

Several minor languages like fre, spa, ara.

# 🏢 Top Publishers by Revenue

Publisher revenue ranking (Page 9):

Penguin Group (USA) LLC is the highest earner.

Followed by Random House and Amazon Digital Services.


# 🖊️ Author Popularity

Based on Book Ratings Count (Page 9):

Intermediate authors receive the highest user engagement.

Famous, Novice, and Excellent follow.

# 📈 Ratings vs Number of Ratings

Scatter plot (Page 10) shows:

Books rated 3.8–4.5 mostly attract the highest number of readers.

Better-rated books generally receive more attention.

# 👑 Top 10 Authors by Gross Sales

Bar graph (Page 11) reveals:

Harper Lee has the highest total gross sales.

Followed by Stephen King and David Sedaris.

# 📅 Units Sold Over the Years

Line plot (Page 12–13) shows:

Sales increased sharply after 1980, with a peak near 2010.

# 📌 Key Insights & Learnings

# 📈 1. Modern books dominate the publishing landscape

Most books are published between 1990–2015.

# 📚 2. Fiction is the most popular genre

More than 70% of books fall under fiction or genre fiction.

# 🌍 3. English is overwhelmingly dominant

"eng", "en-US", and "en-GB" make up almost the entire dataset.

# 🏆 4. Certain authors generate massive revenues

Harper Lee and Stephen King are consistent top earners.

# ⭐ 5. High ratings → more reader engagement

Books with ratings above 4.0 tend to receive significantly more ratings.

# 💡 6. Sales increased dramatically in the 2000s

Indicating a rise in book consumption or availability.

# 📝 Simple Summary (Easy to Understand)

This project analyzes over 1,000 books to understand their publishing trends, genres, ratings, prices, and sales performance. After cleaning the data and performing visual analysis, we find that:

Most books were published between 1985–2015.

Fiction dominates the dataset.

English is the primary language used.

Higher-rated books generally attract more readers.

A few top authors and publishers generate most of the revenue.

Total book sales have increased strongly over the last 50 years.

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, pattern recognition, and generating business insights that can help publishers or retailers understand market trends.
